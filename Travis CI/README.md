Currently designed to test & use inside a Travis-CI temporary virtual enviornment for playback of multimedia.

### Current Build Status from Travis CI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/circuitStatic/headlessmedia.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/circuitStatic/headlessmedia)

* Identified a number of packages that work on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit (which is the suspected Travis-CI enviornment)
* Identified a number of packages that did not work on Ubuntu 12.04. Moved them to bottom commented out area
* Found issue when tryinngn to use players requiring above Python 2.7, since I cannot yet use above that version on Travis-CI, will need alternative to mpg-youtube
